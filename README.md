TFSwipeShrink
=============

A UIView transition helper to minimize a view while allowing user interaction with the background view, similar to the current YouTube iOS and Android apps.

The current YouTube app is the goal and inspiration for this little project. The video minimizing and maximizing being the point of interest.

This is the current (simple) look in minimized position.

### TODO

* Add interactivity to SwipeShrinkView so the user can control the animation.
* Add helper methods to make project easy to implement.
* Make code work with all screen sizes.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repo and open a pull request. Using fairly normal convention, make changes in a separte branch then request to pull into `master`.

I lack the sound detection skills on iOS to get the frequency detection working well, but I'm sure we can make it work together.
